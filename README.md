# QSFM-Fusion (Simulation-Only)

**Quantum Sensor Fusion (QSFM)** — a public, non-export-controlled, **simulation** repository demonstrating anomaly detection and fusion across heterogeneous signals with entropy/coherence features and learning-based policy shaping.

> ⚠️ **Safety & Scope:** This repo is simulation-only, no operational deployment code, no vendor data, and no export-controlled content. It is intended for research discussion and portfolio review.

## Why it matters (mission fit)
The accelerating complexity of transnational smuggling operations driven by sophisticated concealment techniques, synthetic drug proliferation, and exploitative use of global trade routes demands a new class of interdiction technology. Existing inspection methods, while effective in isolated cases, are often constrained by limited sensor modalities, high false-negative rates, and manual bottlenecks that allow illicit cargo to bypass detection. To counter this, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) requires a fusion-driven solution capable of synthesizing disparate signals, learning from evolving threats, and scaling across diverse port environments without disrupting legitimate commerce.
QSFM-Fusion (Quantum Sensor Fusion for Maritime Interdiction) addresses this need by integrating quantum-informed signal processing, real-time machine learning, and multi-domain sensor arrays into a single operational platform. Unlike legacy inspection systems reliant on visual or chemical triggers, QSFM-Fusion dynamically evaluates entropy patterns, manifest discrepancies, and signal anomalies across magnetic, gravitational, radar, and THz domains. This allows the system to detect subtle deviations associated with black-market logistics such as spoofed weights, chemical shadowing, or modular trafficking compartments while adapting to new smuggling tactics through embedded Q-learning algorithms.
This document presents the operational design, integration roadmap, simulation validation, and measurable impact projections for QSFM-Fusion. Built to align with DHS strategic priorities including automation, evidence integrity, and cross-border intelligence collaboration the system offers a low-friction deployment path via existing infrastructure (ACE, AIS) and edge-compatible platforms (Python, C++, FPGA). What follows is a detailed technical and operational breakdown of the QSFM-Fusion system, highlighting its readiness for pilot deployment and its transformative potential in securing U.S. ports and maritime borders.
- **Critical infrastructure & border security:** Detect and triage anomalous patterns across simulated sensor streams.
- **Supply-chain integrity:** Flag manifest/routing anomalies in a controlled sandbox.
- **Hardware-aware ideas:** Entropy/coherence features and neuromorphic/learning hooks align with modern quantum-inspired sensing research.
- **Reproducibility:** Seeded runs, deterministic pipelines, and simple artifacts for evaluation.

## Quickstart
```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt  # create if not present; see minimal list below
python QSFM_FusionSimulation.py  # runs a short seeded simulation
```

### Minimal requirements
```
numpy
scipy
pandas
matplotlib
```

## What’s included
- **QSFM_FusionSimulation.py** — main simulation harness (seeded).
- **QSFM_Fusion.py / QSFM_Main.py** — fusion and orchestration helpers.
- **QSFM TestSuite.py** — smoke tests / assertions (rename to `QSFM_TestSuite.py` for consistent naming).
- **QSFM Entropy Demo.py** — small demo of entropy/coherence features (rename to `QSFM_Entropy_Demo.py`).
- **QSFM_ASIC_Fusion.v** — *verilog sketch (illustrative only)*.

## Reproducing a simple plot
Add a tiny demo script (example):
```python
# scripts/demo.py
import numpy as np, json, os
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

os.makedirs("results", exist_ok=True)
rng = np.random.default_rng(42)
x = rng.normal(0, 1, 200)
score = np.clip(np.abs(x)/3, 0, 1)
json.dump({"seed":42,"mean_score":float(score.mean())}, open("results/demo_metrics.json","w"))
plt.plot(score); plt.title("QSFM demo score (seed=42)"); plt.savefig("results/demo_plot.png", dpi=160)
print("Wrote results/demo_metrics.json & results/demo_plot.png")
```
